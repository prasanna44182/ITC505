      This project is about making the Lights Out game. I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make it. First, I make the game with grid and black blocks. User click on block, and it change color or disappear. The target is to make all blocks disappear and show background image.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also add features like timer, moves counter, and target count. Timer show how much time user take to finish. Moves show how many clicks user did. Target show how many blocks left to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the design, I make page look nice. Background of page is colorful image with balloons. Game box has different image inside it, and blocks cover it like black screen. When user click block, the black block disappear and show image below. This look very nice and fun. I also make hover effect on blocks, so when user move mouse over block, it glow and look better.
    </p>
    <p>
      The info section has "New Game" button. It also show Target, Moves, and Time in simple design. I style this section with white background, rounded corners, and shadow. It look like card. Button also have hover effect, so it change size and color when mouse go over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I face some problem in aligning the grid and showing background image. Sometimes blocks cover the image, and it not look good. I fix it by making blocks transparent when clicked. I also have problem with making page background different from game background, but I solve it using separate CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project teach me about HTML grid, CSS styles, and JavaScript logic. I learn how to make timer and counter also. It was fun and useful project.
