    <p1>In this project, I developed a basic interactive story webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging user experience. The HTML structure includes essential tags like h1 for the title, div elements to organize the story text and choices, and button tags for user interaction. The webpage has a background image and is designed to be responsive, ensuring it adjusts well on different screen sizes. The CSS styling applies a centered layout using Flexbox, with visual effects such as smooth text animations, button hover effects, and image transformations to make the page more interactive. The story text appears gradually with a fade-in effect, and the choice buttons change colors and have a press effect when clicked. An image related to the story is displayed with a shadow and a hover zoom effect, while the restart button offers users a way to start the story over, styled with a red color. The footer dynamically displays the last modified date of the page using JavaScript. Additionally, JavaScript handles the interactive elements by updating the content based on user choices, while ensuring the dynamic display of information like the last modified date. Overall, the project integrates HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for functionality, providing an immersive and responsive experience for users interacting with the story.</p1>
