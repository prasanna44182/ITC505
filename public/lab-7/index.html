    <p>In this lab I engineered a simple web application with the help of Node.js and Express and created a Mad Libs story. For example, the application has input form which allows a user to type a noun, adjective, verb, plural noun, and place. When done, the app creates a story using the inputs the user keyed in. The form data is processed with a POST route and thereâ€™s verification to ensure that all fields in the form are filled before the story creation.

It can also operate static files like an array of CSS file for styling and has individual error detection to inform the users in case they ignore some field. I have also included one more route /do_a_random which does a Math.random and returns a random number between 0 and 1 always converted to an integer by invoking Math.floor on the value.

The form and the result page are designed with CSS in plain manner which does not confuse a user. For logging the requests I used Morgan and for handling form data I used middleware from Express. In this lab I was able to learn how to create full stack web applications using Node.js, process form data and serve static files.</p>
